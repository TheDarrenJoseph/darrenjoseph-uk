    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h2>ARQ (ASCII Roguelike Quester) and ARQ-Rust</h2>
    <p>Back in 2013, I started on one of my first personal programming projects. <a href="https://github.com/TheDarrenJoseph/ARQ/">ARQ (ASCII Roguelike Quester)</a></p>
    <p>I had played a bit of <a href="https://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a> and some other text-based games and wanted to dive into the technical challenges of creating something similar, while learning some C++ along the way.</p>
    <p>I've learned quite a lot while working on this, particularly: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Procedural map generation (with some help from an old colleague: <a href="https://github.com/christopherjsmith">Christopher J Harvey-Smith</a>)</li>
      <li>curses/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> for developing text-based user interfaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As this was a learner project it got a little messy as time went on, and I started to get frustrated at working in C++.</p>
    <p>In 2021, I learned about the Rust language for the first time. After reading about it, I could see it addressed some of my main frustrations around developing in C++, so I was excited to give it a go by porting/re-implementing ARQ.</p>
    <p>This is how <a href="https://github.com/TheDarrenJoseph/ARQ-Rust">ARQ-Rust</a> got started</p>
    <p>Why I prefer Rust to C++:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The borrow checker - ownership/borrowing avoids the chance of accidental runtime pointer errors, and removes to need to worry about memory management too much</li>
      <li>Cargo - Rust's built-in package manager provides a complete dependency management / build system out-of-the-box instead of needing to roll your own dependencies/Makefiles/CMake setup</li>
      <li>Explicit mutable/immutable referencing - which helps you to be clear around your intentions and avoid side effects when designing structs/traits. This also prevents you from concurrently modifying data and forces you to think about where to pass references or where to clone data (data boundaries).</li>
      <li>Built-in unit test support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moving over to Rust went really well, and I was able to redesign quite a lot of things from the ground up, and make some improvements on the original:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display management, ARQ-Rust now uses a "View" (complete UI control, I/O looping) and "Framehandler" (Dumb view that draws a model to a screen frame) system</li>
      <li>An improved start/settings menu with custom widgets</li>
      <li>Music support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is still under development currently, here are some developmental screenshots to give an idea of the project:</p>

    <h2>purses - <a href="https://github.com/TheDarrenJoseph/purses/tree/master">GitHub</a></h2>
    <p>purses (A portmanteau of PulseAudio and curses) is a text-based UI audio visualiser meant for Linux command-line usage</p>
    <p>It hooks up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a> sound server that is popular on Linux systems</p>
    <p>More specifically it's written in C and uses my own implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm">Cooley&#45Tukey FFT algorithm</a></p>
    <p>This seemed line a fun way to learn about Digital Signal processing, and seemed like the perfect opportunity to write something in C</p>

    <h2>This Site - <a href="https://github.com/TheDarrenJoseph/darrenjoseph-uk">darrenjoseph.uk (Github)</a></h2>
    <p>This site is technically also one of my personal projects!</p>
    <p>I've always admired simplistic websites such as those on <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a></p>
    <p>I wanted to create my own little site that could:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use my frontend development experience to create a Minimalist HTML/CSS/JS site while utilising modern browser features/support</li>
      <li>Use my SysAdmin/DevOps experience to manage/maintain my owner server/site setup. (This site is hosted by <a href="https://krystal.io/">Krystal</a> if you're curious)</li>
      <li>Use my (rather limited) experience with image editing (Photoshop/GIMP) to create icons, badges, and banners</li>
      <li>Evoke a slightly retro 90s/early 2000s vibe</li>
      <li>Give me somewhere to play with web technologies/ideas (I will likely add a page for this at some point).</li>
    </ul>
