            <p>This is just an initial welcome post, until I've got more to add here.</p>
            <p>I've kept these blog pages as simple/static pages for now as I don't expect to generate a massive amount of blog content</p>
            <p>If I ever have a lot of content I might migrate it into a CMS, use a static site generator, or something like that; In order to handle the amount of content / speed things up</p>
            <p>I'll be posting here to cover anything interesting in my hobbies (coding projects, and maybe other hobbies)</p>
